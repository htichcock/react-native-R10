## Technology used:

React native, expo/ex-navigation for stacknavigation,
tab navigation(iOS), and drawer navigation(android), react-native-vector-icons,
react-linear-gradient, realm database coupled with redux for persistant state

## Installation:

You'll need either Android Studio or X-code simulator

1.  Download or clone the repo
2.  `cd to/path/of/R10 && yarn`

#### iOS

4.  `react-native run-ios --simulator "iPhone SE"`

#### android

4.  open an android emulator from Android Studio
5.  `react-native run-android`

## todo:

* prop types
* add splash screen and custom icon

ps. there are a lot of warnings due to the latest version of react. see https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18175
