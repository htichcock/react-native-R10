My first react native app for a fake conference

## Technology used:
React native, expo/ex-navigation for stacknavigation, 
tab navigation(iOS), and drawer navigation(android), react-native-vector-icons, 
react-linear-gradient, realm database coupled with redux for persistant state

## todo: 
- prop types
- add splash screen and custom icon


ps. there are a lot of warnings due to the latest version of react. see https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18175
